### Thanks for visit :) 
My name is Daria. I'm engineer of Biotechnology but when I graduated I realized that it isn't my way. I became interested in bioinformatics which led me to start learning programming in Python. In the end, I have taken interest in software development and software testing as well. 

Since December 2020 I have been working as a test analyst in a company providing IT solutions for business. I must admit that every day I get more and more excited about testing and software development. Working as a tester gives an amazing opportunity to learn a lot of different technologies which is just great. 

My goal is to gain new technical skills, which will help me with improvement my testing and programming knowledge.
