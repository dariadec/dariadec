### Thanks for visit :) 
My name is Daria. I'm fresh engineer of Biotechnology but when I graduated I realized that it isn't my way. I became interested in bioinformatics which led me to start learning programming in Python. Recently I have taken interest in software development and software testing as well. My goal is to gain new technical skills, which will help me with improvement my testing and programming knowladge.
